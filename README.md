#Basic Programming Course
Although learning to program was difficult, the course at Platzi was practical. I learned how to program from scratch and mastered Javascript, gained a solid understanding of HTML, and learned algorithms. The course helped me understand the logic of code, how expert programmers think, and how to code a web game from start to finish.

>By the end of the course, I was able to:

- Write fluent code with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Design algorithms, develop software with functions
- Program a video game for the web.
